## DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### **Step 1: Apply Database Migration** ⚠️ REQUIRES SUPABASE ACCESS

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended for Production)**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `iomeddeasarntjhqzndu`
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Copy content from `/app/supabase/migrations/20250625000000_provider_marketplace_system.sql`
5. Execute SQL
6. Verify tables created

**Option B: Via Supabase CLI** (If available)
```bash
cd /app/supabase
supabase db push --db-url postgresql://[CONNECTION_STRING]
```

**Expected Result:**
- 8 new tables created
- RLS policies applied
- Indexes created

### **Step 2: Seed Production Data** ⚠️ AFTER MIGRATION

```bash
cd /app/backend
python scripts/seed_production_data.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- 6 providers seeded
- 7+ local businesses added
- 1 test partner created
- 90 days inventory generated

### **Step 3: Configure Provider API Keys** (Optional for v1)

Add to `backend/.env`:
```env
SABRE_CLIENT_ID=your_sabre_client_id
SABRE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sabre_secret
HOTELBEDS_API_KEY=your_hotelbeds_key
HOTELBEDS_SECRET=your_hotelbeds_secret
AMADEUS_API_KEY=your_amadeus_key
AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your_amadeus_secret
```

**Note**: Can use test/sandbox APIs initially, production keys later.

## CROSS-CHAIN STRATEGY

### **Agglayer Breakout Program - RECOMMENDED** ✅

**Analysis Complete**: `/app/docs/AGGLAYER_STRATEGIC_ANALYSIS.md`

**Key Decision Points:**

**Benefits:**
- 3M POL staker distribution instantly
- Cross-chain infrastructure (10+ chains)
- Polygon ecosystem support
- ROI: 125-350% projected
- Cost: $0.33/user vs $10 traditional

**Costs:**
- 10% token allocation (1M MAKU)
- $170K integration cost
- 9-12 month timeline
- Regulatory complexity

**Recommendation**: **PURSUE** - Best path for global distribution

**Timeline:**
- Q1 2026: Application & legal review
- Q2 2026: Integration development
- Q3 2026: Token launch & airdrop

### **Bridge Aggregator Integration**

**Current State**: Conceptual design ready
**Required**: Implementation for Sui ↔ EVM transfers

**Recommended Solution**: 0x Cross-Chain API

**Implementation Needed** (~2 weeks):
1. Integrate 0x API for bridge aggregation
2. Update unified wallet for cross-chain swaps
3. Handle slippage, fees, confirmations
4. Test Sui → Polygon → Ethereum flows

**Documentation**: Ready to create implementation guide

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS

### **Current Limitations:**

1. **Provider Rotation Using Test APIs**
   - Workaround: Acceptable for v1, real APIs in v2
   - Impact: Limited live availability data

2. **Some Backend Endpoints Need Schema**
   - Affected: Off-season engine (3 endpoints)
   - Workaround: Deploy schema via Supabase dashboard
   - Impact: Minor - core features work

3. **Admin Access Requires Configuration**
   - Affected: /admin/providers route
   - Workaround: Set user role via Supabase dashboard
   - Impact: Low - only affects internal team

4. **Local Businesses Data Limited**
   - Current: 7 destinations
   - Target: 40+ destinations
   - Workaround: Gradual seeding post-launch
   - Impact: Low - can add via admin UI

### **Production Workarounds:**

**v1.0 Launch (Week 1):**
- Deploy with 10 fully-populated destinations
- Use test provider APIs
- Manual admin role configuration
- Limited partner bidding (invite-only)

**v1.1 Update (Week 2-4):**
- Add real provider API keys
- Complete all 40 destinations
- Open partner bidding
- Enable cross-chain features

**v2.0 Major Update (Month 2-3):**
- Full Agglayer integration
- All providers live
- Advanced analytics
- Cross-chain wallet fully operational

**Step 1: Immediate Response** (<5 mins)
```bash
# Disable feature flags
# Via Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Environment Variables
SMART_DREAMS_ENABLED=false
PARTNER_PORTAL_ENABLED=false
```

**Step 2: Frontend Rollback** (15 mins)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Netlify auto-deploys previous version
```

**Step 3: Database Rollback** (30 mins)
```sql
-- Via Supabase SQL Editor
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS partner_bids;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS partner_inventory;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS partner_documents;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS partner_registry;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS provider_rotation_logs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS provider_health_logs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS provider_credentials;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS provider_registry;
```
