- All files present
- No merge conflicts

---

### Step 2: Create Railway Project for Backend

**Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard

**A. Create New Project**:
```
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Authorize Railway to access GitHub (if first time)
4. Select your MAKU.Travel repository
5. Railway will detect Python automatically
```

**B. Configure Service**:

Service Settings:
  - Name: maku-backend
  - Root Directory: backend
  - Builder: Nixpacks (auto-detected)
  - Start Command: uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  - Watch Paths: backend/**
```

**C. Set Health Check**:
```

  - Path: /api/healthz
  - Timeout: 300 seconds
  - Interval: 60 seconds
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

**Railway Dashboard → Service → Variables Tab**

**Option A: RAW Editor (Fastest)**

Click "RAW Editor" and paste:

```
ENVIRONMENT=production
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/maku_production
DB_NAME=maku_production

```

**Option B: One-by-one** (if you prefer UI):
- Click "+ New Variable" for each
- Copy from backend/.env
- Update production values

---

### Step 4: Deploy Backend on Railway

**After Variables Added**:

```
1. Railway auto-deploys (detects GitHub connection)
2. Deployment takes 3-5 minutes
3. Monitor: Deployments tab shows progress
4. Success: Green checkmark ✅
5. Get URL: Settings → Domains → Copy Railway URL
   Example: https://maku-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

**Verify Deployment**:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/healthz

# Should return:
{
  "ok": true,
  "version": "0.1.0-offseason",
  "db": "up",
  "features": ["partner_campaigns", "smart_dreams", ...]
}
```

---

### Step 5: Configure Netlify for Production

**Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Configuration → Environment Variables**

**Add/Update These Variables**:

```
VITE_REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://iomeddeasarntjhqzndu.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_TOKEN_HERE
VITE_OFFSEASON_FEATURES=true
VITE_PROVIDER_ROTATION_ENABLED=true
VITE_DREAM_LIBRARY_ENABLED=true
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Trigger Redeploy**:
```
1. Deploys → Trigger deploy
2. Or push to GitHub (auto-deploys)
3. Build takes 2-3 minutes
4. Netlify URL: https://your-site.netlify.app
```

---

### Step 6: Update CORS with Actual Netlify URL

**After Netlify Deploys**:

**In Railway**:
```
1. Copy Netlify URL (e.g., https://maku-travel.netlify.app)
2. Railway → Variables → Update CORS_ORIGINS
3. Set to: https://maku-travel.netlify.app,https://maku.travel
4. Railway auto-redeploys with new CORS
```

---

### Step 7: Set Up Custom Domains (Optional)

**For Backend (Railway)**:
```
1. Railway → Settings → Domains
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Enter: api.maku.travel
4. Add CNAME record in your DNS:
   - Name: api
   - Value: your-project.up.railway.app
5. SSL auto-provisions
```

**For Frontend (Netlify)**:
```
1. Netlify → Domain Management
2. Add custom domain: maku.travel
3. Configure DNS:
   - Add A record or CNAME to Netlify
4. SSL auto-provisions
```

---

### Step 8: Verify Complete System

**Test Backend (Railway)**:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/healthz

# Provider marketplace
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/marketplace/health

# Dream library
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/dream-library/featured

# Blockchain
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/blockchain/network-info

# All should return 200 OK with JSON
```

**Test Frontend (Netlify)**:
```
1. Visit: https://your-netlify-url.netlify.app
2. Check: Homepage loads with images
3. Verify: Navigation works
4. Test: Dream library page loads
5. Check Console: No CORS errors
6. Verify: API calls to Railway backend succeed
```

**Test Integration**:
```
1. Search for hotels/flights
2. View dream packages
3. Check provider analytics
4. Test booking flow
5. Verify blockchain features (NFT, wallet)
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Railway Build Fails

**Check**:
```
1. Deployment logs in Railway
2. Verify requirements.txt is in backend/
3. Check Python version (should be 3.11)
4. Verify all dependencies install correctly
```

**Fix**:
```
Add nixpacks.toml with:
[build.env]
PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"
```

### Issue: Backend Can't Connect to Supabase

**Check**:
```
1. SUPABASE_URL env var is set
2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is correct
3. Supabase allows connections from Railway IPs
```

**Fix**:
```
Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API
- Verify service role key
- Check connection pooler settings
```

### Issue: Frontend Can't Call Backend (CORS)

**Check**:
```
1. Browser console shows CORS error
2. CORS_ORIGINS in Railway includes Netlify URL
```

**Fix**:
```
Railway → Variables → CORS_ORIGINS
Set to: https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app
Redeploy
```

### Issue: Images Not Loading

**Check**:
```
1. Browser console shows 404 for images
2. Image URLs in dream library
```

**Fix**:
```
All images verified at 100%
Check network tab for actual failing URL
Verify Unsplash API limits (free tier: 50 requests/hour)
```
