## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Authentication Issues
Likely causes:
1. Supabase client configuration
2. Auth context provider issues
3. Session management problems
4. Token expiration/refresh issues

### Booking Flow Issues  
Likely causes:
1. Missing API endpoints
2. Database connection issues
3. State management problems
4. Payment integration failures

### Admin Dashboard Issues
Likely causes:
1. Import path inconsistencies (partially fixed)
2. Missing components
3. Incomplete implementations
4. Data fetching errors

## üöÄ Recovery Strategy

### 1. Authentication Recovery
```typescript
// Check points:
1. Verify Supabase URL and keys in .env
2. Test Auth Context provider
3. Validate session persistence
4. Check auth guards on protected routes
```

### 2. Booking Flow Recovery
```typescript
// Check points:
1. Verify booking API endpoints
2. Test payment integration
3. Check booking state management
4. Validate booking confirmation flow
```

### 3. Dashboard Stabilization
```typescript
// Check points:
1. Fix all import paths
2. Implement missing components
3. Connect to real APIs
4. Add error boundaries
```
