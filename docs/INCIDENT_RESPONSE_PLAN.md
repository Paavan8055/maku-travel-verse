## Incident Classification

### P0 - Critical (Response Time: Immediate)

**Definition:** Complete service outage or critical functionality broken

**Examples:**
- Website completely down
- Payment processing not working
- Database inaccessible
- Mass user lockouts
- Data breach or security incident

**Response SLA:** 15 minutes
**Communication:** Every 30 minutes until resolved

---

### P1 - High (Response Time: 30 minutes)

**Definition:** Major functionality degraded affecting many users

**Examples:**
- Search functionality broken
- Blockchain features unavailable
- Slow API responses (>5s)
- Travel Fund creation failing
- Authentication issues for subset of users

**Response SLA:** 30 minutes
**Communication:** Every hour until resolved

---

### P2 - Medium (Response Time: 4 hours)

**Definition:** Non-critical features affected or minor performance issues

**Examples:**
- UI rendering issues
- Analytics not tracking
- Admin dashboard errors
- Slow page loads (<5s but degraded)
- Minor API errors (< 5% failure rate)

**Response SLA:** 4 hours
**Communication:** Daily updates

---

### P3 - Low (Response Time: Next business day)

**Definition:** Cosmetic issues or minor bugs

**Examples:**
- Typos or formatting issues
- Console warnings
- Minor accessibility issues
- Feature requests

**Response SLA:** Next business day
**Communication:** As needed

---

## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection & Alert (0-5 minutes)

**Automated Detection:**
- Sentry error spike alert
- Uptime monitor ping failure
- Performance threshold breach
- Error rate threshold (>1%)

**Manual Detection:**
- User report via support
- Team member observation
- Social media mention

**Actions:**
1. Acknowledge alert within 5 minutes
2. Create incident in tracking system
3. Assign severity level (P0-P3)
4. Notify on-call engineer

---

### Phase 2: Triage & Assessment (5-15 minutes)

**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] What is the user impact?
- [ ] How many users affected?
- [ ] What functionality is broken?
- [ ] Is data at risk?
- [ ] Is this a security issue?

**Initial Checks:**
```bash
# Check service status
curl https://maku.travel/health
curl https://api.maku.travel/api/health

# Check Sentry for error patterns
# Open Sentry dashboard and review last 15 minutes

# Check server resources
ssh production-server
top  # CPU/Memory usage
df -h  # Disk space

# Check database
mongosh "mongodb+srv://..." --eval "db.stats()"
```

**Decision Tree:**

```
Is site completely down?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ P0: Enable maintenance mode, investigate immediately
â””â”€ NO  â†’ Continue

Is payment/critical feature broken?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ P0: Investigate and escalate
â””â”€ NO  â†’ Continue

Are >50% of users affected?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ P1: High priority response
â””â”€ NO  â†’ Continue

Is this a security issue?
â”œâ”€ YES â†’ P0: Security protocol, escalate to CTO
â””â”€ NO  â†’ P1 or P2 depending on impact
```

```

---

### Phase 4: Investigation & Diagnosis (15-45 minutes)

**Systematic Investigation:**

**1. Recent Changes:**
```bash
# Check recent deployments
git log --oneline -10

# Check Netlify deploys
# Review last 3 deployments in dashboard

# Check configuration changes
git diff HEAD~5 -- '*.env' '*.toml' '*.yml'
```

**2. Error Analysis:**
```bash
# Sentry: Look for patterns
- Common error messages
- Affected endpoints
- User agents/browsers
- Geographic distribution

# Backend logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/supervisor/maku-backend.err.log | grep ERROR

# Frontend errors
# Check browser console in Sentry session replay
```

**3. Resource Check:**
```bash
# Server resources
free -h  # Memory
df -h    # Disk
top      # CPU

# Database performance
# Check MongoDB Atlas metrics
# Look for slow queries

# Network connectivity
ping api.maku.travel
curl -I https://api.maku.travel/api/health
```

**4. Dependency Status:**
```bash
# Check external services
curl https://status.mongodb.com
curl https://status.supabase.com
# Check Polygon RPC status

# Test connections
node scripts/validate-environment.js
```

**Common Root Causes:**

| Issue | Symptoms | Quick Check |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Deployment Bug** | Errors after recent deploy | Check Sentry for new errors |
| **Database Connection** | 500 errors, timeouts | `mongosh` connection test |
| **Environment Vars** | Missing data, config errors | Check .env files |
| **Resource Exhaustion** | Slow responses, timeouts | `top`, `df -h`, `free` |
| **External API Down** | Specific feature broken | Test external API endpoints |
| **Rate Limiting** | 429 errors | Check rate limit logs |
| **Certificate Expired** | SSL warnings | `openssl s_client -connect maku.travel:443` |

---

### Phase 5: Resolution & Fix (Varies)

**Hotfix Process:**

```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/issue-description

# Make minimal changes to fix issue
# Test locally
yarn test:e2e --grep "critical"

# Commit and push
git commit -m "hotfix: [description]"
git push origin hotfix/issue-description

# Deploy via Netlify/platform
# Or for backend:
ssh production
cd maku-travel
git pull
sudo supervisorctl restart maku-backend
```

**Temporary Workarounds:**

**Disable Feature:**
```typescript
// Feature flag to disable broken feature
const FEATURE_ENABLED = false;

if (FEATURE_ENABLED) {
  // Broken feature code
}
```

**Fallback Mode:**
```python
# Fallback to cached data if API fails
try:
    data = fetch_from_api()
except Exception:
    data = get_cached_data()
```

**Maintenance Mode:**
```bash
# Enable maintenance page
cp maintenance.html dist/index.html
# Deploy
```

---

### Phase 6: Verification (10-30 minutes)

**Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Error rate returned to normal (<0.1%)
- [ ] Affected functionality working
- [ ] No new errors in Sentry
- [ ] Performance metrics normal
- [ ] User reports stopped
- [ ] Monitoring stable for 15 minutes

**Testing:**
