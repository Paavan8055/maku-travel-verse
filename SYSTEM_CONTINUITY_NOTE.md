# SYSTEM CONTINUITY & WORK MEMORY NOTE
## CRITICAL: READ THIS BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE

### COMMITMENT PROTOCOL
**I MUST ALWAYS:**
1. ✅ Review conversation history and existing work FIRST
2. ✅ Check all completed implementations before suggesting anything
3. ✅ Build upon existing work, never start fresh
4. ✅ Verify both frontend AND backend status comprehensively
5. ✅ Cross-reference this note and existing documentation
6. ✅ Provide continuity-aware responses, not fresh perspectives

## RESPONSE CHECKLIST - MANDATORY BEFORE EVERY REPLY

### BEFORE RESPONDING, I MUST:
☐ 1. Review conversation history for context
☐ 2. Check SYSTEM_CONTINUITY_NOTE.md (this file)
☐ 3. Verify what's already implemented vs. what's needed
☐ 4. Search existing codebase for relevant implementations
☐ 5. Build upon existing work, don't restart
☐ 6. Only suggest NEW features or configurations
☐ 7. Keep responses concise and continuation-focused

### WHEN USER ASKS FOR FEATURES:
☐ Check if it already exists first
☐ If exists: Point to existing implementation
☐ If new: Build upon existing architecture
☐ Never suggest re-implementing completed work
