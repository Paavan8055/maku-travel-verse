# Testing Standards for MAKU.Travel

## Phase 2: Test Environment Standardization - Complete ✅

This document outlines the completed testing standardization for the MAKU.Travel project.

### Implementation Status

#### ✅ Phase 2: Test Environment Standardization
- **Simplified Supabase Mocks**: Removed invalid database table references
- **Centralized Test Utilities**: Created reusable mock factories and setup functions
- **Built-in Test Reporting**: Using Vitest's native reporting instead of custom database logging

#### ✅ Phase 3: Dependency Resolution
- **Clean CI Configuration**: Removed `--legacy-peer-deps` from all CI steps
- **Optimized Caching**: Improved npm caching strategy in GitHub Actions
- **Consistent Package Management**: Standardized npm usage across environments

#### ✅ Phase 4: Environment Consistency
- **Node.js Standardization**: Added `.nvmrc` for consistent Node.js 20 usage
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Updated GitHub Actions to use `.nvmrc` and clean npm commands
- **Improved Performance**: Removed legacy flags and optimized dependency installation

### Test Utilities Structure

```
src/test-utils/
├── index.ts              # Main entry point with re-exports
├── mockFactories.ts      # Centralized mock creation functions  
├── testSetup.ts          # Reusable setup functions and data factories
└── README.md            # Usage documentation
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**: Centralized all mock patterns
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all test utilities
3. **Performance**: Optimized mock creation and cleanup
4. **Consistency**: Standardized testing patterns across the codebase
5. **Maintainability**: Single place to update mock implementations

### Next Steps

The testing infrastructure is now standardized and ready for development. All phases (2, 3, 4) are complete:

- ✅ Reusable test utilities implemented
- ✅ CI configuration optimized  
- ✅ Node.js environment standardized
- ✅ Dependencies cleaned up

The team can now run `npm ci` without `--legacy-peer-deps` and use the centralized test utilities for consistent, maintainable tests.
