# Testing Standards for MAKU.Travel

## Phase 2: Test Environment Standardization - Complete ✅

This document outlines the completed testing standardization for the MAKU.Travel project.

### Implementation Status

#### ✅ Phase 2: Test Environment Standardization
- **Simplified Supabase Mocks**: Removed invalid database table references
- **Centralized Test Utilities**: Created reusable mock factories and setup functions
- **Built-in Test Reporting**: Using Vitest's native reporting instead of custom database logging

#### ✅ Phase 3: Dependency Resolution
- **Clean CI Configuration**: Removed `--legacy-peer-deps` from all CI steps
- **Optimized Caching**: Improved npm caching strategy in GitHub Actions
- **Consistent Package Management**: Standardized npm usage across environments

#### ✅ Phase 4: Environment Consistency
- **Node.js Standardization**: Added `.nvmrc` for consistent Node.js 20 usage
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Updated GitHub Actions to use `.nvmrc` and clean npm commands
- **Improved Performance**: Removed legacy flags and optimized dependency installation

### Test Utilities Structure

```
src/test-utils/
├── index.ts              # Main entry point with re-exports
├── mockFactories.ts      # Centralized mock creation functions  
├── testSetup.ts          # Reusable setup functions and data factories
└── README.md            # Usage documentation
```

### Key Improvements

The standardization provides several benefits:
- **Reduced code duplication**: Centralized mock factories eliminate repetitive mock setup
- **Enhanced type safety**: All utilities are properly typed with TypeScript
- **Improved performance**: Optimized CI configuration with proper caching and Node.js standardization
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all test files
- **Maintainability**: Changes to mocks can be made in one place and propagated across all tests

## Phase 3: Dependency Resolution ✅ COMPLETE

### Dependency Structure Cleanup
- **Testing dependencies moved to devDependencies**: Successfully moved `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, and `vitest` from dependencies to devDependencies
- **Production bundle optimization**: Testing libraries are now excluded from production builds, reducing bundle size
- **Clean dependency separation**: Runtime and development dependencies are now properly categorized
- **Package cleanup executed**: Removed and re-added testing packages to ensure proper categorization

### NPM Cleanup Procedures
The following cleanup commands are recommended for maintenance:
```bash
npm dedupe     # Remove duplicate packages
npm prune      # Remove unused packages  
npm audit --production  # Security audit for production dependencies only
```

### Dependency Categories
- **Runtime dependencies** (`dependencies`): Packages required for production application runtime
- **Development dependencies** (`devDependencies`): Testing libraries, build tools, linters, and dev-only utilities
- **Type definitions**: Properly categorized based on whether they're needed at runtime or build time

### Next Steps

The testing infrastructure is now standardized and ready for development. All phases (2, 3, 4) are complete:

- ✅ Reusable test utilities implemented
- ✅ CI configuration optimized  
- ✅ Node.js environment standardized
- ✅ Dependencies cleaned up

The team can now run `npm ci` without `--legacy-peer-deps` and use the centralized test utilities for consistent, maintainable tests.
