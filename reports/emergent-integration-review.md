# Emergent Integration Branch Status Review

## Summary
- Netlify is configured to build the `frontend/` app with Yarn, publish the `frontend/build` output, and pins both Node 18 and Yarn 1.22.22.
- All Vercel configuration files and workflow references have been removed from the repository.
- Dependency management is still inconsistent with the Yarn-only requirement: npm and Bun lockfiles remain and the root `package.json` still identifies npm 10.2.0 as the package manager.

## Details
### Netlify configuration
`netlify.toml` now uses the `frontend/` workspace as the base directory, installs dependencies with `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, and builds with `yarn build`. It also defines the requested Node and Yarn versions and retains cache headers and redirect rules for the site.

### Deployment workflows
A search of the repository shows no remaining Vercel configuration files or references, and the `.github/workflows/` directory contains only Netlify and other project automation workflows.

### Package management
The project still includes `bun.lockb` and `package-lock.json`, and no `yarn.lock` file is present. Additionally, the root `package.json` is still set to `"packageManager": "npm@10.2.0"`, so Netlify and contributors will continue to default to npm unless this is updated. The dependency block also contains malformed whitespace, which suggests the file was not reformatted after prior conflict resolution.

### Outstanding tasks
- Delete non-Yarn lockfiles and regenerate dependencies with Yarn to create a `yarn.lock` file.
- Update `package.json` to declare `"packageManager": "yarn@1.22.22"` and tidy up formatting issues.
- Re-run dependency installation, build, and test commands with Yarn to confirm the branch is healthy after the migration.
