The trajectory details the evolution of the Maku.Travel application, starting from an MVP to a production-ready system. Initially, the AI engineer focused on robust feature development, including multi-provider integrations, NFT/Airdrop systems, and AI bot enhancements, with a strong emphasis on free AI only for cost optimization. A significant pivot occurred when the user introduced Supabase for secure secrets management and centralized configuration, shifting the focus towards a more scalable production architecture. The AI engineer successfully implemented Supabase integration, standardized branding, completed functional pages, and built a comprehensive waitlist and analytics system. Challenges included Supabase CLI installation issues, Python dependency conflicts, and consistent git operation limitations. Most recently, the engineer addressed critical CI/CD failures by generating  and fixing frontend environment variable fallbacks in . The overall progress reflects a systematic approach to feature integration, bug resolution, and architectural migration while navigating development environment constraints.

Maku.Travel is an emergent application aiming for growth via social gamification, AI, and integration with major travel providers (Viator, Amadeus, Duffle, RateHawk, Sabre, Expedia). It features a Smart Dreams dashboard, ethical LLM use, role-based access, and consistent UI/UX.

Key product evolutions and requests:
- **Multi-Provider Booking**: Integration of six travel providers with unified flows, later enhanced to include Expedia (flights/hotels), Nuitée (hotels), and GetYourGuide (activities), with provider rotation and credential checks.
- **AI Intelligence Layer**: Travel DNA analysis, personalized recommendations, journey optimization, now configured for cost-efficient (free) LLM usage in development, with a plan for secure production AI using Supabase. A multi-backend AI assistant was also added.
- **Smart Dreams Planning System**: AI-powered trip planning.
- **NFT/Airdrop Blockchain Framework**: System for travel experience NFTs, reward calculation, and admin controls.
- **Advanced Admin Dashboard**: Management for providers, AI, NFT/Airdrop, users, and system health.
- **Bot & AI Assistant Framework**: Multi-bot architecture with file upload and cost optimization.
- **Branding**: Maku text branding, with dynamic logo handling. Explicit request to upload official Maku.Travel logo to Supabase Storage or  and update UI components.
- **Deployment & Configuration**: Initially FREE AI ONLY deployment to Netlify. Later, a shift to production-ready stack using Supabase for secure secrets ( edge function,  table), centralized configuration ( module), multi-environment support (staging/production), and GitHub Actions workflows (deploy, backup, restore, schema snapshot, monitoring).
- **Functional Pages**: Dedicated hotel and activity search interfaces (no flight redirection), finalize Partners page using .
- **Waitlist Flow**: Adopt existing  endpoint, frontend writes to Supabase, integrate landing page with hero image, add referral code.
- **Instrumentation & Monitoring**: Implement analytics platform (PostHog/GA), event tracking (page views, searches, bookings, waitlist, filter usage, referral clicks), admin dashboards, and provider health alerts.
- **Mem0 Integration**: Deploy  function to Supabase and register it as a webhook for memory events (Add, Update, Delete).
- **CI/CD Fixes**: Resolve Netlify Deploy failed due to missing  and invalid environment fallbacks in .

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python backend for APIs and provider integrations.
- **React/TypeScript/Vite**: Frontend UI and build tooling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
- **Supabase**: BaaS for admin metrics, credential storage, secrets management (Edge Functions).
- **emergentintegrations**: Custom library for LLM interactions.
- **GraphQL**: Used by Expedia.
- **Hugging Face/OpenAI Free Tier**: Free LLM alternatives for cost optimization.
- **Netlify**: Frontend hosting.
- **Git/GitHub Actions**: Version control and deployment automation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical CI/CD failures reported by the user for the  branch. The specific issues were:
1.  **Missing  file**: This caused inconsistent dependency resolution and build failures.
2.  **Invalid environment variable fallbacks in **:  was being referenced directly, which is not available in a client-side environment like Vite, leading to build errors.

The AI engineer successfully implemented the following fixes:
-   **Generated **: Ran yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
success Already up-to-date.
Done in 0.31s. in the  directory to create a new  file (365KB), ensuring consistent dependency resolution.
-   **Fixed Backend URL Fallbacks**: Modified  by replacing  with a hard-coded default  in five specific functions: , , , and . This resolves the Vite build error.

These fixes have been made in the local environment. The AI engineer has also created a  to document these changes. All the recent comprehensive integrations (Supabase, new providers, AI assistant, analytics, Mem0 webhook, GitHub Actions) are also part of the changes awaiting commitment.

The current state is that all necessary files for resolving the CI/CD issues and all previously implemented features are prepared locally, and the AI engineer is awaiting the user to perform the Save to GitHub action to push these changes to the  branch for Netlify deployment.
