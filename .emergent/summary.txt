The trajectory details the Maku.Travel application's development, transitioning from initial feature creation to production readiness under an AI engineer. Initially, the focus was on AI, multi-provider integration, and NFT/Airdrop features. A major pivot occurred with Supabase integration for secrets and configuration, enhancing security and robustness. Significant work involved resolving Netlify deployment issues, frontend runtime errors in the Travel Fund Manager, and extensive branding updates. The project then evolved into phased development: Phase 1 focused on AI diagnostics, achievements, and cashback calculator; Phase 2 introduced mock blockchain infrastructure (MAKU token, NFTs, API endpoints); Phase 3 integrated the frontend wallet and fixed UI/UX issues. Recent efforts addressed critical bugs, refined collaborative planning, and established comprehensive testing and deployment preparation (Phase 6 & 7), including environment validation, error tracking, and documentation, ensuring a robust path to production.

<product_requirements>
Maku.Travel is an emergent social gamification and AI-powered travel application, integrating major providers (Expedia, Viator, etc.). It features a Smart Dreams dashboard, ethical LLM use, role-based access, and consistent UI/UX. The application evolved to include multi-provider booking, an AI intelligence layer for personalized recommendations, an NFT/Airdrop blockchain framework, and an advanced admin dashboard. Deployment matured from FREE AI ONLY to a production-ready stack with Supabase for secure secrets and centralized configuration, supported by GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Recent enhancements focused on fixing Netlify CI/CD, significantly improving the Travel Fund Manager's UX/UI with gamification, NFT integration, and cross-feature connectivity (checkout, Smart Dreams, bidding, rewards). Further requests include resolving Smart Dreams AI loading issues, ensuring user data accuracy in Achievements, enforcing UI/UX consistency (white backgrounds, visible fonts), developing a cutting-edge collaborative planning feature, finalizing the Rewards section with 1-10% MAKU crypto token cashback, and designing NFT reward tiers with a monetization strategy.
