The AI engineer systematically enhanced the Maku.Travel application, resolving critical bugs and integrating core features. Initial work focused on deploying an Off-Season Occupancy Engine, including Supabase schema, backend APIs, and frontend dashboards. A major sign-up bug due to a shared Supabase environment was resolved by manual SQL migration and backend validation. Subsequent efforts integrated Sentry for error tracking, deployed smart contracts (Hardhat setup, deployment script), and implemented ChatGPT Pro for AI-driven features, including cost monitoring. The engineer also fixed a critical frontend sign-in error caused by a syntax issue in  and resolved continuous price drop alerts errors by handling non-existent Supabase Edge Functions gracefully and fixing a function hoisting bug in . Finally, the agent tackled pervasive data inconsistency issues by building a unified metrics service, replacing mock data with real API calls for Smart Dreams V2 (AI scoring, caching, provider rotation), and updating marketing copy, culminating in the integration of real metrics into the frontend, addressing an  dependency issue.

Maku.Travel is an AI-powered travel app with Smart Dreams and multi-provider integration. The initial goal was to enhance it with social gamification, NFT/Airdrop blockchain, and an advanced admin dashboard. The MAKU Zero Empty Beds directive led to implementing an Off-Season Occupancy Engine, including new Supabase tables, FastAPI endpoints, and feature-flagged frontend UI for partners and admin. A rule-based Yield Optimizer, templated email nudges, and documentation were also required. UI/UX fixes (Navbar spacing, link deduplication), NFT membership tier updates, and Plan Together integration were crucial. The latest directives focus on replacing randomized Smart Dreams scoring with deterministic AI-powered logic (ChatGPT Pro), enforcing provider rotation, centralizing platform metrics, removing all demo data, and updating time-sensitive content to reflect the current live status, ensuring data consistency and trust.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central FastAPI application. Modified to import and include new FastAPI routers for off-season, email, OpenAI, Smart Dreams V2, and Unified Metrics. Sentry error tracking was also initialized here.
-   ****: Frontend entry point. Modified to initialize Sentry for frontend error tracking.
-   ****: Manages user authentication state. Fixed a critical bug involving duplicate closing braces and a function hoisting issue related to , which caused sign-in errors and reload loops.
-   ****: Manages price alerts. Modified to handle calls to a non-existent Supabase Edge Function gracefully, preventing continuous error toasts, and showing a service unavailable state.
-   ****: New service for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro. It was updated to accept a model parameter and to include  and other necessary methods, fixing initial implementation errors.
-   ****: New FastAPI endpoints for Smart Dreams V2, handling AI scoring, provider rotation searches, and cache/rotation statistics.
-   ****: New frontend API client for Smart Dreams V2 endpoints, enabling communication with the AI-powered backend for scoring, searches, and stats.
-   ****: Modified to route all provider searches through the new Smart Dreams V2 endpoints, enforcing provider rotation and AI scoring.
-   ****: User dashboard for Smart Dreams. Significantly refactored to replace  calls with real AI-driven scores from the V2 API, and to display loading states.
-   ****: Admin dashboard for Smart Dreams. Updated to display real cache and provider rotation statistics fetched from backend endpoints, replacing mock data.
-   ****: New backend service to consolidate and expose platform-wide metrics (Travel Fund, Smart Dreams).
-   ****: Homepage section displaying Travel Fund banner. Modified to fetch and display real, consistent metrics from the new unified metrics service.
-   ****: Dedicated Travel Fund page. Updated to display metrics from the unified metrics service, resolving discrepancies with the homepage.
-   ****: Frontend data file. Edited to remove explicit Demo Data labels from hotel entries.
-   ****: Displays featured hotel/flight/activity listings. Modified to remove API Demo badges and related demo indicators.
-   ****: Hook for fetching featured deals. Modified to ensure Demo Data badges are not shown.
-   ****: About Us page. Updated to reflect that Smart Dreams is LIVE NOW instead of Launching 23 Oct 2025.
-   ** / **: Updated to include new backend (, , ) and frontend (, ) dependencies.

<pending_tasks>
-   UI/UX Standardization (replacing gray with white, No Purple or Black, WCAG AA compliance - partially started).
-   Advanced Integrations (real-time features, advanced analytics beyond current metrics).
-   Deployment of Smart Contracts to Mumbai testnet (Hardhat setup done, but not explicitly deployed).
-   Run Slither security audit on smart contracts.
-   Ensure all time-sensitive promotions reflect the current season (Australian users/Indian users).
-   Implement multi-city/flexible date searches for flights and detailed hotel filters.
-   Implement secure payment gateways and local payment methods.
-   Refine AI-driven personalization for Smart Dreams (persona-based journeys, prefilling search fields).
-   Blockchain and rewards integration: concrete token utility, network details, real-time NFT minted/remaining.
-   CMS or headless backend for marketing copy.
-   Everything is logically sync to Admin, Users, Partners and Suppliers.
-   Automated tests for data consistency.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer addressed critical platform data consistency issues. A  was created on the backend and an endpoint  was exposed, now correctly returning aggregated platform statistics. Frontend components, specifically  (Travel Fund banner on homepage) and  (dedicated Travel Fund page), were updated to fetch and display these unified metrics, resolving previous discrepancies in reported figures. All explicit Demo Data labels were systematically removed from  and API Demo badges from . Time-sensitive copy, such as the Smart Dreams launch date on , was updated to reflect the current live status. During the final verification, an  import error on the frontend was identified and resolved by installing the  package via yarn install v1.22.22
