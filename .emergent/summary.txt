The AI engineer systematically developed the Maku.Travel application, focusing on critical feature implementation and stabilization. The process involved several phases: initial codebase audit, Supabase schema creation for the Off-Season Occupancy Engine, backend API development for campaign management and yield optimization, and frontend UI creation for partners and admin dashboards. Key challenges included resolving Supabase environment variable issues and an invalid API key, necessitating user intervention. The engineer also performed extensive UI/UX fixes on the Navbar (spacing, link deduplication) and integrated Plan Together across Travel Fund and Smart Dreams, along with updating NFT/Airdrop tiers. Comprehensive testing was performed for both backend and frontend. The major existing user bug during sign-up was identified as a shared Supabase database issue in the forked environment, which was resolved by obtaining the Supabase service role key and guiding the user through manual SQL migration, followed by successful backend validation with a real user ID.

Maku.Travel is an AI-powered travel application featuring Smart Dreams and multi-provider integration. The goal is to enhance it with social gamification, an NFT/Airdrop blockchain framework, and an advanced admin dashboard. Recent efforts included fixing Netlify CI/CD, improving the Travel Fund Manager's UX/UI with gamification and NFT integration, and developing a collaborative planning feature. The current directive, MAKU Zero Empty Beds, focuses on implementing an Off-Season Occupancy Engine. This involves creating new Supabase tables (, , , , , ), corresponding backend FastAPI endpoints (e.g., , , , ), and frontend UI for partner/admin dashboards, all feature-flagged. A rule-based Yield Optimizer (v1) scoring mechanism, templated email nudges, and comprehensive documentation are also required. Additionally, UI/UX issues, such as duplicate links and logo spacing, needed fixing. NFT membership tiers and Plan Together integration across relevant features were crucial.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****: Significantly refactored to remove duplicate navigation links (e.g., Rewards), hide admin-related components from regular users, improve spacing around the Maku logo, and integrate the new Off-Season Partners link.
-   ****: Modified to import and include new FastAPI routers from  and , expanding API capabilities.
-   ****: Updated to include a Plan Together integration badge and CTA within its hero section, linking it to the collaborative planning feature.
-   ****: Revised to update NFT tier names (e.g., from Wanderer to Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) and corresponding cashback percentages (1%, 3%, 6%, 10%), including updates to testimonials and descriptive text.
-   ****: Updated to synchronize NFT tier names and cashback percentages with the new system, affecting tier benefits, current tier displays, testimonials, and descriptive sections.
-   ****: Modified the planner tab to correctly navigate to the Plan Together page when its button is clicked, integrating smart dreams with collaborative planning.
-   ****: Expanded to include new links such as Plan Together and Off-Season Deals within the Products and Smart Travel sections, and a new Rewards section was added. Required new icon imports (, ).
-   ** (NEW)**: Contains new FastAPI routes for managing off-season campaigns, smart dreams suggestions, wallet operations, and yield optimization.
-   ** (NEW)**: Implements the rule-based scoring logic for the Yield Optimizer, including unit tests.
-   ** (NEW)**: Provides API endpoints and logic for templated email nudges, designed to queue email payloads rather than sending actual emails.
-   ** (NEW)**: Landing page for off-season partners.
-   ** (NEW)**: Dashboard for partners to manage their campaigns.
-   ** (NEW)**: Admin dashboard for tracking KPIs related to off-season deals.
-   ** (NEW)**: SQL migration script to create new Supabase tables (, , , , , ) with RLS and indexes.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical issue where new users were encountering existing user errors during sign-up due to a shared Supabase database in the forked environment. After receiving the  from the user, the engineer guided the user to manually apply the  migration to the Supabase database. Following the migration, the engineer verified Supabase connectivity and then re-ran comprehensive backend tests (). This final round of testing, using a real user ID () obtained from the Supabase database, confirmed that all off-season API endpoints were fully functional and interacting correctly with the newly migrated Supabase schema, including operations like creating dream intents, optimizing yields, and managing partner campaigns.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the frontend implementation of the Off-Season Occupancy Engine features to ensure they correctly interact with the now-functional backend endpoints.
