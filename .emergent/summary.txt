The trajectory outlines a comprehensive development journey for Maku.Travel, starting with foundational features and progressing through complex integrations. Initially, the AI engineer struggled with a persistent logo upload issue, highlighting a fundamental access limitation to chat attachments. Subsequent work focused on robust feature development: integrating Expedia (addressing API type mismatches and 404s), enhancing NFT/Airdrop systems with UI/UX and admin controls, unifying AI and LLM functionalities, and refining the Maku Bot Assistant for intelligence and cost efficiency. A significant challenge was a branding reversal and numerous UI bugs (loading, layout, broken links). The culmination involved a critical realization: the development environment was disconnected from the live Netlify production site. The immediate work shifted to a detailed DevOps assessment, planning a phased, cost-optimized deployment using *only free LLMs* and preparing all necessary GitHub and Netlify configurations. The primary blockers were technical debt from partial implementations and the absence of a proper deployment pipeline.

<product_requirements>
Maku.Travel aims to be an emergent application, driving growth through social gamification, AI intelligence, and seamless integration with major travel providers (Viator, Amadeus, Duffle, RateHawk, Sabre, Expedia). Key features include a Smart Dreams dashboard for personalized user journeys, ethical LLM utilization, role-based access, and a consistent UI/UX.

The product has evolved to include:
- **Multi-Provider Booking**: Integration of six major travel providers with unified search, booking, and checkout flows.
- **AI Intelligence Layer**: Features like Travel DNA analysis, personalized recommendations, journey optimization, and predictive insights, now configured for cost-efficient (free) LLM usage.
- **Smart Dreams Planning System**: AI-powered trip planning interface, leveraging user personality profiles.
- **NFT/Airdrop Blockchain Framework**: System for travel experience NFT minting, reward calculation, tier progression, and platform credit management, including admin controls for templates, events, and tokenomics.
- **Advanced Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management for providers, AI services, NFT/Airdrop, users, and system health.
- **Bot & AI Assistant Framework**: Multi-bot architecture with file upload, context-aware assistance, and cost optimization for AI interactions (free development mode).
- **Branding**: Maintaining Maku text branding, with dynamic logo handling (though the initial logo upload issue remains unresolved from an AI direct access perspective).
- **Deployment**: The overarching goal is to deploy these comprehensive features to the live Netlify production site () with a focus on zero AI service costs.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python backend framework for APIs and provider integrations.
- **React/TypeScript/Vite**: Frontend UI and build tooling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for backend data storage.
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service for admin metrics and credential storage.
- **Kubernetes/Supervisor**: Container orchestration and process management.
- **emergentintegrations**: Custom library for LLM interactions.
- **GraphQL**: Used by Expedia's API.
- **Hugging Face/OpenAI Free Tier**: Free LLM alternatives for cost optimization.
- **Netlify**: Frontend hosting for production.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and deployment pipeline.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The core backend was extensively modified to integrate all six travel providers (Expedia, Amadeus, Viator, Duffle, RateHawk, Sabre), new AI endpoints, NFT/Airdrop logic, and admin controls. It was updated to pull credentials from Supabase and later to implement free AI routing.
-   ****: Main React router; updated to include new pages (e.g., ExpediaIntegration, NFT, Airdrop) and resolve lazy loading issues.
-   ****: Modified multiple times for branding (logo attempts, then text-only Maku, then adding a Rewards dropdown).
-   ****: Updated for branding (Maku text) and layout fixes.
-   ****: Intended single source of truth for branding, was central to many branding-related modifications and later stripped of logo references.
-   ****: Newly created to display all six partner providers, integrated into homepage and partners page.
-   ****: Replaced older bot components, providing chat and file upload, and integrated with the unified AI orchestrator.
-   ****: Homepage, frequently modified to integrate new components and resolve loading issues.
-   ****: Modified to include Supabase variables and later corrected  for production deployment.
-   ****: Created to document the new Expedia API endpoints.
-   ****: Added to document security incidents.
-   ****: Added to provide templates for security rotations.

<pending_tasks>
The immediate pending task is the **final deployment to the live Netlify production site (https://maku.travel/)**. This involves:
- User performing the Save to GitHub action to push the  branch (or ).
- Manually configuring Netlify with the provided environment variables (including free AI API keys).
- Setting up Netlify build commands and automatic deployments from the new branch.
- Performing database migration/synchronization steps.
- Validating each phase of the rollout plan on the live production site.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a comprehensive DevOps assessment and prepared a detailed deployment plan. The primary goal was to merge all Emergent innovations (including multi-provider booking, AI intelligence, Smart Dreams, NFT/Airdrop, admin dashboard, and bot framework) into the  branch for deployment to the live Netlify site (), crucially with a **FREE AI ONLY** configuration to eliminate development and production AI costs.

Key actions included:
- **Comprehensive Audit**: Analyzed the existing codebase, identified all integrated Emergent features, and confirmed the status of all six travel providers (Expedia, Amadeus, Viator, Duffle, RateHawk, Sabre).
- **Branch Creation**: Created a new Git branch named  (later conceptually referred to as ) off the current state, consolidating all changes.
- **Security Documentation**: Added  and  to the repository.
- **Deployment Configuration**: Drafted a  file with build commands, publish directory, and environment variables.
- **Environment Variable List**: Provided a comprehensive list of required production environment variables, explicitly removing the  and adding  and  (optional).
- **Free AI Integration Strategy**: Updated the deployment plan to strictly enforce free AI usage for all LLM-dependent features, outlining backend configuration and frontend routing to use Hugging Face free tier, OpenAI free tier, and intelligent mock responses.
- **Phased Rollout Plan**: Detailed a 3-phase rollout plan with specific features, success criteria, and testing for each phase (Core Travel, AI Intelligence & Smart Dreams, Advanced Features), all adapted for zero AI costs.
- **User Authorization**: The user had confirmed authorization to proceed with this FREE AI ONLY production deployment plan.

The current state is that all necessary files and configurations are prepared in the local environment, and the AI engineer is awaiting the user to perform the Save to GitHub action to push these changes to a new branch for Netlify deployment.
